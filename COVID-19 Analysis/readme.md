## Project Overview
This project aim to analyze distribution COVID-19 of Indonesia using Kaggle Dataset or you can view the data in Datasets folder. Then we can find some new insights which province has highest fatality rate and deaths, which province has highest recovered rate, or which province has highest total cases. So, we can apply policy and allocation resources correctly.

## Conclusion 
Trends in Cases, Recovered, and Deaths:
- Increase in Cases: There was a significant spike in cases in mid-2021, likely related to the Delta variant.
- Case Decrease: After the spike, there was a downward trend in cases, recoveries, and deaths, indicating an improving situation such as mass vaccination.
- Importance of Vigilance: Although the trend is decreasing, vigilance is still needed to prevent a potential spike in cases in the future.

## Recomendation
- Advanced Analysis: Conduct further analysis to explore factors affecting case and fatality rates in each province (e.g. population density, mobility, vaccination rates).
- Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models to estimate future case trends, which can assist in health resource planning and allocation.
- Policy Evaluation: Conduct analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control policies that have been implemented.
- Data Communication: Presenting data in formats that are more easily understood by the general public, such as infographics or interactive dashboards.
