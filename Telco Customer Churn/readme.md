The aim of this project is to analyze customer demographics, area code, states, and other features to predict customer will churn or not. Customer churn defined as when customer discontinue doing bussines with a service or company.

However, if the company could forecast which customer are likely discontinue subscription, it could be focus customer retention only on these 'high risk' customers. So, customer churn is critical metric because it's less expensive to retain existing customers than it's to acquire new customers.
